**Description:**

Mooshroombase is an ambitious project aimed at creating a free and powerful alternative to popular platforms like Supabase, Firebase, Pocketbase, and Stream (video calling platform). The goal is to provide a flexible and efficient solution that offers full control over everything, including automation and manual configurations, all in one program.

**Why Go is the main language of Mooshroombase:**

Mooshroombase is designed to handle 20,000 concurrent users with all its features, except real-time database, on a single core with 800 MB of RAM. This is achievable because REST APIs don't consume much resources, and Go is well-suited to handle such a workload. In fact, I've tested many REST APIs written in Go and found it to be more than capable.

**Reason for Discontinuation:**

Unfortunately, I've had to discontinue this project due to a lack of resources. I'd love to continue working on Mooshroombase if I could secure a job, but without financial support, I'm unable to continue. It's disappointing to have to quit on my 200th project, especially after completing 199 others.

**Notice**
The Code might look that simple but I tried to make it simple not use golang's style I tried using statefull way feel free to check it out.
